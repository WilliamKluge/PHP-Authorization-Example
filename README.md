# PHP-Authorization-Example
An example of a PHP page that requires a user to be authorized to visit.

## What these pages do
* authorized_page.php : The page that will require users to be authorized
* login.php : Page that users use to log in
* login_tools.php : Just gives us a neat little page load function
* logout.php : Page that will end the user's session (log them out, kick them off the authorized page)
